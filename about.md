title: About me 
---

It's simple. Every day I encounter problems while programming. I search for the solution, I debug ad infinitum, I (hopefully) figure it out. 

I'd like to save you some head-scratching. So I'll post about my triumphs, to help others as I have been helped.

These posts will cover mostly front-end development and the other tools of my trade. And other topics such as productivity, remote working, workflow, creativity, and agency life.

Cheers!
